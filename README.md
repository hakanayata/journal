## Distinctiveness and Complexity

My final project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements because of the following elements:

1. This project is specifically focuses on "Productivity" and designed as a productivity tool. It provides users with a dedicated platform to journal their daily experiences, thoughts, and ideas in an organized manner, enhancing their productivity and well-being.
2. Journal App features a dynamic & interactive calendar which I built from scratch to motivate users to keep journaling without skipping a day. The calendar allows users to navigate through dates and view their journal entries for specific days in an intuitive way.
3. This project utilizes a rich text editor for entries' content field, helping users to format their entries with features like bold, italic text. This enhances the writing experience and enables users to be more expressive at journaling.
4. Journal App includes a feature that calculates and displays user's longest streak of consecutive journaling days. This functionality was built form scratch to motivate users to maintain a consistent journaling habit.
5. The app has a feature that allows users to filter their journal entries by month and year. This helps them to gain insights and reflect on their past experiences.
6. After its submission, this project will be deployed to Python Anywhere, a platform for hosting and running Django applications. As a by-product of this deployment, MySQL will be the choice of database rather than SQLite. Moreover, the deployment will ensure that the app is accessible online, allowing users to use its features from any device with an internet connection.
