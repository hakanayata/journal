CS50W Final Project - Journal App




## Distinctiveness and Complexity

1. This application is specifically focuses on "Productivity" and designed as a productivity tool. It provides users with a dedicated platform to journal their daily experiences, thoughts, and ideas in an organized manner, enhancing their productivity and well-being.
2. This app features a dynamic & interactive calendar which I built from scratch to motivate users to keep journaling without skipping a day. The calendar allows users to navigate through dates and view their journal entries for specific days in an intuitive way.
3. This app utilizes a rich text editor for entries' content field, helping users to format their entries with features like bold, italic text. This enhances the writing experience and enables users to be more expressive at journaling.
4. Journal App includes a feature that calculates and displays user's longest streak of consecutive journaling days. This functionality was built form scratch to motivate users to maintain a consistent journaling habit.
5. The app has a feature that allows users  to filter
6. After its submission, this project will have been deployed to Python Anywhere, a platform for hosting and running Django applications. This deployment will ensure that the app is accessible online, allowing users to use its features from any device with an internet connection.
